    "proof-step-3-desc": "Events from A to Z. Agency coordination, timelines, budgets, logistics, follow-up. I do not hand things off and hope they land. I stay in the room until it is done. And I make sure it looks right before anyone sees it.",

    "proof-step-4-desc": "Every event, every activation, every sponsorship gets reviewed. What worked. What did not. What do we do differently next time. No vanity metrics. Just honest answers that make the next one better.",
